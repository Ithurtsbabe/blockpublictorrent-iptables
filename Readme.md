Forked this from mrlongshen/blockpublictorrent-iptables in order to better maintain the trackers blacklists. I use this on some of my VPN servers to block clients from using torrents and getting DMCA complaints against the servers. 

Install

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ithurtsbabe/blockpublictorrent-iptables/main/bt.sh && chmod +x bt.sh && bash bt.sh```
